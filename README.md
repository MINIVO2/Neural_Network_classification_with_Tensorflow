## ðŸ“¸ Introduction to CNN & Computer Vision with TensorFlow

This repository contains an end-to-end walkthrough of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification using TensorFlow and Keras. It covers both **binary** and **multi-class classification** tasks and demonstrates the core concepts of modern computer vision workflows.

### ðŸš€ What You'll Learn

- How to preprocess and load image data using `ImageDataGenerator`
- Building and training CNN models for binary and multi-class classification
- Visualizing model predictions on custom images
- Handling overfitting with data augmentation
- Comparing model performance with and without augmented data
- Saving and loading trained models

### ðŸ§  Models Built
- Binary classification CNN (Pizza vs Steak)
- Multi-class food classification CNN (10 food classes)
- Augmented data training and performance comparison
- Final model saved and reused for custom predictions

### ðŸ§ª Datasets Used
- Binary Classification: `pizza_steak` dataset  
- Multi-Class Classification: `10_food_classes_all_data`

### ðŸ”§ Technologies
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Matplotlib
- NumPy
- Jupyter Notebook

### ðŸ“‚ Structure
